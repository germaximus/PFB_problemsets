Alice by Shel Silverstein

Alice loves me,
Alice cares,
Alice picks me peaches and pears.
Alice offers me candy and Cokes,
Alice listens and laughs at me jokes.
Alice helps when I get in a fight,
Alice does all my homework at night.
Alice misses me,
Alice cries,
Alice thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Alice is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Alice just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Alice's hand,
In the darkness where Alice usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Alice's gone!
